# Bark

Bark is a simple static site generator written in Haskell.
It is designed primarily for the author's personal use, but can be tweaked to suit just about anyone :>

## Installation
(TODO)

## Usage
To initialize a project with bark, use the following command:

```sh
$ bark init project
$ cd project
```
Once you run the commands above, you should see a directory with the following structure:

```sh
.
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── assets
    └── style
```
