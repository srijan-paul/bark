# Bark

Bark is a simple static site generator written in Haskell.
It is designed primarily for the author's personal use, but can be tweaked to suit just about anyone :>

## Installation
This tool isn't on hackage yet, but will be soon.
So while we're being cultured and patient folks, you could install bark from source.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `sh build.sh` to compile, the exe should then be in `./dist/bark`.
3. Run `sh build-site.sh` to build the website.
